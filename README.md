A chess notepad for the digital age

### * Basic version
The basic version will have no assistance. You can type any valid move and add it to the notebook. When finished you can export the moves you have made

### * Notepad checker
The notepad checker will go through the moves that were submitted and indicate any move that is illegal. This will help identify if a move is illegal in a game or if you entered the move incorrectly

### * Keyboard checker
The keyboard checker will warn on submit if the move you are trying to submit is a legal move. For example e4=Q is not a legal chess move. The keyboard checker will prevent any illegal move structures

### * Intuitive Keyboard
#### Not intended for competitive play
The intuitive keyboard will help predict the move you want to type. Based on the moves made during the game and the buttons already pressed move suggestions will be displayed. Illegal moves buttons will also be disabled only allowing for legal move entries
